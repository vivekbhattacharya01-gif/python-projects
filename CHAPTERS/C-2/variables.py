# VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES IN PYTHON---

#  A Variable is the name given to a memory location in  a program. 
#              OR
#  we could say that a variable is a container that holds data values.


x = 5         # VARIABLES = container to store value  
y = "Hello"   # Keywords = reserved words in python that have special meaning and cannot be used as variable names.
z = 3.14      # Data Types = the type of data that a variable can hold, such as integers, strings, floats, etc.


a =1
b= 2
print (a+b)

# Here a and b are the variables and 1 and 2 are the values assigned to the variables a and b respectively.
